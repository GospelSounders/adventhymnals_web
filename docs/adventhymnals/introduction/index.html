      <h4>Advent Hymnals</h4>
<p><img src="/charles-wesley-hymn-690x385.jpg" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<h1>Advent Hymnals</h1>
<p><em>What songs have cheared the adventist band since their great disappointment in 1844?</em>  These are all contained in this project. Advent hymnals is a master collection of all the hymns sung by adventists as contained in such hymnals as Christ in Song, Church hymnal and Seventh Day adventist hymnal, millenial harp, etc. These are a rich source of church history as well as of music.</p>
<p>The sum of these songs minister to the downcast soul, to the weary soul, and tells us all the duty that we owe to God and to our fellow men. Listen to this one from <code>Millenial Harp</code>:</p>
<pre><code>There will be a mighty wailing, there will be a mighty wailing,
There will be a mighty wailing, at the old church yards,
While the band of music, while the band of music,
While the band of music shall be sounding through the air.

O Sinner you will tremble, O Sinner you will tremble
O Sinner you will tremble, at the old church yards,
While the band of music, while the band of music,
While the band of music shall be sounding through the air.

You will flee to rocks and mountains, you will flee to rocks and mountains,
You will flee to rocks and mountains, from the old church yards,
While the band of music, while the band of music,
While the band of music shall be sounding through the air.
</code></pre>
<p>While they sang in early adventism <code>when we all get to heaven</code> and other chearing songs alongs the same lines, it was not lost to them the need of warning the sinners both in Zion and in Babylon of their pathetic fate if they continued stiffing their necks in sin. Why has this Spirit been lost from the church so that nobody wants to hear the straight testimony anymore? Could it be that this is due to the fact that such staight-testimony songs have been lost sight of?</p>
<p>Here is another one from Christ in Song. Notice the third stanza.</p>
<pre><code>1 Some one will enter the pearly gate
By and by, by and by,
Taste of the glories that there await,
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?
Some one will travel the streets of gold,
Beautiful visions will there behold,
Feast on the pleasures so long foretold:
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?

2 Some one will gladly his cross lay down
By and by, by and by,
Faithful, approved, shall receive a crown, 
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?
Some one the glorious King will see,
Ever from sorrow of earth be free,
Happy with Him thro' eternity: 
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?

3 Some one will knock when the door is shut
By and by, by and by,
Hear a voice saying, &quot;I know you not,&quot;
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?
Some one will call and shall not be heard,
Vainly will strive when the door is barred,
Some one will fail of the saint's reward:
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?

4 Some one will sing the triumphant song
By and by, by and by,
Join in the praise with the blood-bought throng,
Shall you? shall I? shall you? shall I?
Some one will greet on the golden shore
Loved ones of earth pain and parting o'er,
Safe in the glory for evermore:
Shall you? shall I? Shall you? shall I?
</code></pre>
<h2>What is contained in Advent Hymnals?</h2>
<p>This is an ambitious project, already spanning more than a year. At the end of it, it should be able to achieve the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text for all the songs in all hymnals used by Adventist from Millenial Harp of 1843 all the way to the present one.</li>
<li>Tunes for all of these hymns.</li>
<li>Links to renditions of these songs if they exist, or to those sang by singing software if human renditions of the same are not available.</li>
<li>Identify and make visible all points where there is an error in any of the songs, such as in Millenial Harp where it says of the second advent <code>Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet</code>. This is part of singing with understanding.</li>
<li>Identify all changes that have been introduced in the modern hymnals and the reasons behind those changes.</li>
<li>Avail all this data in an easy to use mobile phone application.</li>
<li>Avail also a desktop application for personal use or for projecting in public worship.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Then What?</h2>
<p>You may not have the priviledge of singing these songs in your church. Maybe you belong to one of those churches where most people know but a few songs and they never ever want to learn any new one, so that it is the same rounds meeting after meeting. But remember that in your family worship you can sing these. We will continue doing all that we can so as to make learning the songs here so easy that a child uneducated in music can learn them on his own.</p>
<p>As you continue singing, you will learn such deep Bible truths that can never be effaced.</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>You can scroll through the available hymnals using the menu where you will also be able to access some studies in music.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The following structure has been adopted for the hymns to enable as much information as possible to be given for any particular hymn:-</p>
<p>Each hymn page has two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The top section having the text/lyrics of the hymn in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bottom section having additional information about the hymn, including:</p>
</li>
</ol>
